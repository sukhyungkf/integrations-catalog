    The Avi Vantage Any Agent allows for the management of Certificates stored in the Avi Vantage ADC solution.  The types of certificates stored in Avi are Application, System, and CA certs.  Application and System certs are used by Avi for SSL offloading. They need to have a private key present. CA certs are the public CA certs without private keys that are used to build the chain of the SSL certs.
